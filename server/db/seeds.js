Red deer, mountain hares, lizards, amphibians, insect-eating sundew plants and a host of invertebrates also thrive on peatlands. Peatlands are also really important for people. For example, most of Scotland’s drinking water is filtered through peatlands. Healthy peatlands produce clean water which requires fewer chemicals to treat. SCOTLAND'S PEATLANDS - Peatland cover 20% of Scotland's land. The majority of the UK's peatlands are in Scotland. Scotland is home to the Flow Country, in Sutherland. This vast peatland is under consideration for World Heritage Site status because it is a globally-rare type of blanket peatland. The Flows alone holds 5% of the global blanket bog resources. But 80% of Scotland’s peatlands are degraded in some way.  This affects their ability to capture carbon, provide home for wildlife and produce clean water."
